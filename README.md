# Calorie-Estimator

In response to the increasing significance of monitoring calorie intake for a healthy lifestyle, especially in the context of combating the obesity epidemic, we have developed an innovative web application focused on Indian cuisine. This application simplifies the task of calorie tracking by employing YOLO (You only look once) deep learning algorithm to identify various Indian food dishes from photos and estimate their caloric content. With a remarkable accuracy of 91% Mean Average Precision, the app is capable of precisely detecting 10 types of dishes. It also has a very friendly User Interface made by using Flask Framework for seamless use. By providing users with real-time information about the calories in their meals, our application aims to empower individuals to make healthier dietary choices and foster improved eating habits. This project serves as a valuable tool in the broader effort to promote a healthier lifestyle and combat the challenges associated with excessive calorie consumption.
